## Razorfish Client Preview

This is the Razorfish Client Preview platform built by Razorfish Portland. This system is usable by all Publicis/Omnicom brands. For instructions on how to use this platform once it is setup, see the user guide. 


#### Installation

1. Download the most recent build of the Razorfish Client Preview platform from Github at [https://github.com/GarrettGillas/RFStaging](https://github.com/GarrettGillas/RFStaging) and unzip it to your desktop.
2. Open the file siteconfig.php with a text editor and edit the usernames and passwords of the 3 login accounts and then save the file. You will need these accounts to login to the site.
3. FTP all of the files from to the root folder of the domain that you want to setup. This can be either a Linux server or a Windows server running PHP.
4. Login using the admin account and then go to the setup page to define the project information. 
5. Once this is done, the site is ready to use. Refer to the user guide for further instructions on how to use the Razorfish Client Preview platform.


#### FAQ

- Q: What languages is the Razorfish Client Preview platform built on?
- A: This platform is built using PHP & Javscript. However, it uses several other tools and libraries such as jQuery, BonobosCMS, jScrollPane, jReject & SWFObject.

- Q: Does this platform use a database?
- A. No. All of the media is stored locally and all of the settings are stored in dynamically generated PHP files. 

- Q: Wouldn't it be way better if you just built this thing using a database?
- A: Yes. Due to the nature of Razorfish's IT policies though, it was actually quite hard to get both a webserver and some way to access a database. This platform was created, in part, to navigate "around" certain corporate IT policies that were making things difficult for me.

- Q: Where can I get this platform's source code?
- A: It can be pulled down from [https://github.com/GarrettGillas/RFStaging](https://github.com/GarrettGillas/RFStaging).

- Q: What software license is this platform published under?
- A: None. Since this platform was built by employees of Razorfish Portland, it belongs to Razorfish LLC and is not available to license the public currently. However, it is available for use to all Razorfish sister companies under the Publicis/Omnicom umbrella.


#### Troubleshooting

- Problem: I have uploaded the files and when I visit the site I have it setup under in a browser, all I see is a bunch of files listed. 
- Solution: Check your server for default document types. If you are on a Windows server you will need to add "index.php" as a default document type in IIS.

- Problem: The setup page doesn't seem to be changing anything. 
- Solution: Check the file permission settings on your server. They should be set to 777 for any files and folders that are used by this platform. 

- Problem: I can't delete project folders from the web interface.
- Solution: See the solution listed above. 

- Problem: When I upload files using the web interface, they do not show up on the project page.
- Solution: Again, check the file permission settings. 

- Problem: I have a problem that is not listed here.
- Solution: You can contact support by emailing garrett.gillas@razorfish.com. If you have a bug or feature that you would like addressed, please explain it in detail and I will be happy to include it in the next release.
